## Integromat Webhook (Make)

[Integromat](https://www.make.com/en) is a powerful automation platform that allows you to connect various apps and services, enabling you to automate workflows and streamline your business processes. By integrating Integromat with your booking system, you can enhance the functionality and efficiency of your booking process.

To set up the Integromat integration and receive a webhook for each reservation made, follow these steps:

1. Sign up for an account on [Integromat](https://www.make.com/) if you don't have one already.

2. Create a new scenario in Integromat to define the actions you want to perform when a booking is made.

3. In your Rails project, add the following environment variables to your configuration:

   ```ruby
   INTEGROMAT_BASE_URI="https://hook.eu2.make.com"
   INTEGROMAT_BOOKING_HOOK="odsdispsdsbseb1hrjqe56jqm35snc"
   ```

   Replace the values above with your own Integromat base URI and booking hook.

4. Whenever a booking is made in your booking system, a webhook will be triggered and sent to the specified Integromat hook. You can then use this webhook to automate processes in your Integromat scenario, such as sending notifications, updating external systems, or performing any custom actions you require.
